# PolynomialCalculator

Welcome to Polynomial Calculator! Here is a quick user guide:

Step 1: Open the Polynomial.java file in your IDE of choice.

Step 2: Run the class in order to use the calculator.

Step 3: When asked whether you want to add, subtract, or evaluate polynomials, make sure to type exactly "add", "subtract", or "evaluate" (without the quotation marks) in the prompt window.


Tips for entering the coefficients of your polynomial:

The coefficients of a polynomial is the number being multiplied by the variable. 
For example, the coefficent of 7x^2, is 7.

This calculator can only deal with coefficients that are integers (will not take decimals or fractions)

Make sure to type each coefficient with only one space in between (no commas or anything else)

This calculator assumes your polynomial is in order from highest degree to lowest degree.

For example if your polynomial is "2x^2 + 4x +5",

You would enter "2 4 5"

If there is no value for a certain degree, the coefficient would be 0. 

For example if your polynomial is "3x^3 + 4x + 2"

You would type "3 0 4 2"


Thanks for using Polynomial Calculator! Happy Mathing!
